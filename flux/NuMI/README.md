# Purpose
This directory contains the fluxes for each component of the NuMI beam at the NOvA ND. At 14.6 mrad off-axis, the primary component of the flux is sharply peaked at 1.9 GeV. These fluxes were calculated from NOvA CAF files using the novasoft function DeriveFlux. The macros that actually performed this operation are `deriveFlux.C` and `extract_histos.C`.
