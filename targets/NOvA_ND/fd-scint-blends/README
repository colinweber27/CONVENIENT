These data files and scripts compute the mean scintillator density for
near and far detectors and the masses of each type of scintillator for
the far detector.

They are not run as part of the build because they require csvtool,
which is not part of a standard Linux installaton.  The output file of
'blockreport *.csv' is included as "reportbyblock" which contains lines giving
the scintillator blend name, how much scintillator was from each blend in
gallons, and how many kilotonnes of scintillator this represents.

You can run 'summarize' which reads it and prints the final report.  I have
manually put the result into the composition and GDML files.
