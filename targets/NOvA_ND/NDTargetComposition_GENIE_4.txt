# Purpose: To record the chemical composition of the NOvA ND in GENIE target composition format. These numbers were obtained from running /nova/app/users/colweber/compositions/soup.py for the ND, and then recording only elements and isotopes that make up at least 0.01% of the detector, assuming that the nuclei in the detector follow the natural isotopic abundances as given by the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics.

# Command: none. This is just a reference for now.
