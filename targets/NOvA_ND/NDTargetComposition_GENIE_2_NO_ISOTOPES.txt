# Purpose: To record the chemical composition of the NOvA ND in GENIE target composition format. These numbers were obtained from running /nova/app/users/colweber/compositions/soup.py for the ND, and then recording only elements that make up at least 1% of the detector. No isotopes are included in this formulation of the composition, although in general they should be.

# Command: none. This is just a reference for now.
