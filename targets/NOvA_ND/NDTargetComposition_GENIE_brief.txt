# Purpose: To record the chemical composition of the NOvA ND in GENIE target composition format. This file is a briefer version of "NDTargetComposition_GENIE.txt" that includes only the top 3 most abundant elements. It assigns fractions to keep the relative ratios between these elements the same as in the other file.

# Command: none. This is just a reference for now.
